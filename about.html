          <h1>About</h1>
          <p>
            â€‹I am an independent videographer and photographer based out of
            Columbus, OH with a desire to curate content for clients from all
            backgrounds. I provide on-site work that allows me to create a
            client-specific experience that is tailored to you.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2017, the sports arena initially drew me to this line of work. I
            deeply admire the passion and grit that each athlete possesses as
            they continue to strive for excellence. The dedication they have to
            perfect their craft inspires me to further perfect mine and
            adequately capture their hard work and grind, both on the field and
            behind the scenes. I have extensive experience in videography,
            photography, and editing for events, teams, and individuals in the
            sports realm, including professional athletes, various local sports
            organizations and leagues, trainers around the Columbus area, the
            2019 Columbus Destroyers of the Arena Football League, and the
            Scholastic Play-by-Play Classic held in Columbus at Nationwide
            Arena.
          </p>
          <p>
            By 2019, my interests broadened as I became motivated to curate
            content for individuals, events, corporations, and businesses of all
            backgrounds. Expanding my horizons has allowed me to work with
            clients outside of Ohio, in places such as Hawaii, Arizona, The
            Bahamas, Florida, Chicago, and NYC. I take great pride in the
            opportunity to generate and brand an image for my clients. My goal
            is to provide each client with high-quality video and photo content
            that allows them to market themselves at a higher level than their
            competitors. I value service and communication, and I work with each
            client individually to ensure that the delivered content exceeds
            expectations.
